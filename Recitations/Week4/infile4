After the launch of new technologies we hear of the benefits these latest
developments will bring to humans and societies. As the latest innovations become integrated within,
and form the infrastructure of, everyday living, we begin to experience some
less positive aspects. Clearly, computer technology brings both benefits and
disadvantages. Accordingly, we start to compare between the advantages and disadvantage of the technology and its 
impact on our life-style and practices; the degree to which either has an impact on individuals and
their ability to live a "good life" is the degree to which ethics is relevant to
computing.  
A number of ethical issues have been discussed and debated over the
last twenty years or so under the broad category of "computer ethics" by scientists, engineers, 
and practioners. This rather loose term has been criticised for placing ethics - a uniquely human
characteristic - onto computers. Despite early predictions in Artificial
Intelligence we are still far from being able to ascribe a moral viewpoint to
mechanical devices. If, however, we talk about the ethics of computing we
are talking about the use of computers - thus placing the moral perspective
(and consequently the moral responsibility) firmly into the hands of
computing professionals and the users.
